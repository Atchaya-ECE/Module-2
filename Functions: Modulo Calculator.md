# Ex-02-Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a function called `result` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
2. Inside the function, compute the modulo using `a % b`.
3. Print the result of the modulo operation.
4. Get two integer inputs from the user.
5. Call the `result` function with the user-provided values.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def result(a,b):
    mod=a%b
    
    print(f"modulo is {mod}")

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

result(a,b)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator has been executed successfully.
